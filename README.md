# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project implements a **Credit Card Fraud Detection System** using Machine Learning with an **ensemble stacking model (Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost + Logistic Regression meta-learner)**.  
It includes:  
- **Data preprocessing** with feature engineering.  
- **Handling class imbalance** using SMOTE and undersampling.  
- **Model training and evaluation** (RandomForest, XGBoost, CatBoost).  
- **Stacking Ensemble** for improved fraud detection.  
- **Flask web application** for real-time and batch fraud detection.  
- **Visualization of fraud vs legitimate transactions**.
